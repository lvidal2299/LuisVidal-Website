        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biochemistry B.S ðŸ”¬</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I was born and raised in San Diego, California (though not in wealthy areas). Both my parents escaped severe poverty in Mexico and moved to the United States so that I would not have to worry about this. And even if poverty here is not as bad as in Mexico, I was still surrounded by gangs, violence, drugs, and poverty. In spite of not speaking English and not having family, both my parents went out to find a job in order to put food on the table and a roof over my head. This inspired me at a young age to decide that I, too, would make my own sacrifices for my family. My three hour commute throughout middle and high school was the foundation for the rest of my education. I can proudly say that I am the first person in my entire family and the first person in my known family history to attend university.  <br><br>

        Itâ€™s a constant uphill battle as a first-generation, low-income student. My love for science in high school led me to pursue a degree in STEM: Biology. Entering college was a huge step for me and my family. I remember not being allowed to attend a UCR tour by my high school because I was told I would never even be able to attend university. And here I am defeating the odds. But I came into college not knowing what to expect. I immediately fell in love with my chemistry classes and found it astounding how life could be described at the molecular level. At the end of my first year, I applied for the SALSA Summer Research Scholars program in order to get my first real taste in research science. After being accepted, I completed a project on the LOF1 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana using a CRISPR/Cas9 complex that I constructed with the help of my graduate student mentor. <br><br>

        This research not only further deepened my interest in science, but it made me realize I was in the completely wrong major. I made the decision to pursue a bachelors in Biochemistry to further strengthen my knowledge in human proteopathies. I made the transition into Dr. Groverâ€™s Bioengineering lab in March 2019 in order to find more translational research to the medical field. Here I am working on developing a low-cost method for identifying counterfeit medication. I am using the ImageJ software to develop chronoprints which can document changes in substanceâ€™s viscosity. Concurrently I am improving the efficiency of a thermoelectric cooler in order to replace liquid nitrogen in these trials making the techniques developed by the lab more accessible. I not only love the research that I am doing, but I now know what I want to do in the future. I have decided to pursue an MD/PhD where I will be given creative freedom to develop new drugs and form part of a team of physicians to run clinical trials. Entering college was only one of the first obstacles I will face. Less than one percent of physicians in the US are Latinos; but the motivation and strength that I get from my family will allow me to get to where I want to be.
